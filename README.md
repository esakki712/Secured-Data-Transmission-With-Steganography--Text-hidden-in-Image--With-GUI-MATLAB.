# Secured-Data-Transmission-SenderEnd-ReceiverEnd-With-Steganography--Text-hidden-in-Image--With-GUI.
Implementation of several algorithms including AES, RSA, SHA-256, PVD Steganography Algorithm, and many more for the creation of separate sender end and receiver end programs using which they can securely communicate. GUI implementation has been done for the ease of access. This project ensures CIA in Network Security and has been implemented in MATLAB 2019b.
